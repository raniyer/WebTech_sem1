      <h3>It's the little things that matter</h3>
      <p>Would you like to travel and give something back to the communities you visit at the same time? Do you want to make the world a better place? Have you got skills you’d like to share? Do you want to learn new skills while helping others? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘YES’, then volunteering with an NGO could be the perfect choice for you. </p>
      <p> NGO stands for non-governmental organization. These are non-profit charities or groups set up by ordinary citizens that operate independently of governments. There are more than 10 million NGOs worldwide, and they can be local, national or international. All of them work with volunteers in some capacity.        Some NGOs are extremely well known, such as Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, the World Wildlife Fund and Save the Children. Others are tiny in comparison, and work very locally, on the ground with a specific community. But all NGOs have a mission and work to provide support to people, animals, and the environment in some way. Some NGOs work to improve policy; others offer direct help with issues related to poverty or mental health, for example; some do a mixture of these, and they all rely upon donations and volunteering from ordinary citizens to achieve their goals. </p>
